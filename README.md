# Simple Encryption Tool

## Overview

This project is a Rust application designed to encrypt and decrypt single files using AES, also known as the "Advanced Encryption Standard" algorithm. It leverages Rust's powerful features to ensure performance and safety.

## Features

- **Encrypt Files**: Uses the AES algorithm to encrypt files securely.
- **Decrypt Files**: Decrypts files that were encrypted using the AES algorithm.
- **Generate AES Key**: Generates a secure 32-byte AES key for encryption and decryption.

## Installation

To install the application, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust.

Once Rust is installed, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-abd-elkahlk/Simple-AES-Encryption-Cli-Tool
cd Simple-AES-Encryption-Cli-Tool
